# inliner
Inlines external attributes of html elements (styles, images), making the document or section of document portable.

This is just a wrapper for my other inline libraries to do everything at once. If you only need to inline one type of thing, you can just use one of the individual libraries (will be smaller that way).

## Currently Supported
Nothing yet.
